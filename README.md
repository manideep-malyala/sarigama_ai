# SaRiGaMa.AI Music Separation Utility

SaRiGaMa.AI is a user-friendly music separation utility that allows users to easily separate different components of a music track into individual audio files. Using the pre-trained open-source model Spleeter from Deezer, SaRiGaMa.AI employs several powerful Python libraries, including Pydub, Pytube, Mutagen, Yt-Dlp etc, to isolate tracks such as vocals, drums, bass, compressing and converting them into MP3 files. 

## Usage

This repository contains a Google Colab IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use SaRiGaMa.AI The notebook includes step-by-step instructions on how to install the required dependencies and perform music separation on a sample audio file.

To get started with SaRiGaMa.AI, simply open the Google Colab notebook and follow the instructions. The resulting audio files can be saved and manipulated separately to create custom remixes or improve the quality of your recordings.

## Beginner-Level Project

This tool is designed for those interested in learning Python and audio processing, making it a great beginner-level project. SaRiGaMa.AI is perfect for musicians, sound engineers, and anyone else who needs to extract specific elements from a music track for remixing, composition, or noise reduction purposes.
